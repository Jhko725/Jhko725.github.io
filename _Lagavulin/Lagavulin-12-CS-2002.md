Quite an old vintage, this one. In fact there was quite some bit of evaporation and the cork broke while opening. Quite excited to try this one.

# Nose
Dusty attic, dust covered and stale white peppercorns. Old but white oak planks with a coat of dust. Stale bananas slightly grazed with a blowtorch. Some wood spice/slightly underripe apricots but really soft and stale and rounded and oxidized... as if those elements were stuck under the bed for some time. 

Stale vanilla cream gone slightly sour and with more dust thrown in. With time, the sourness and the dustiness lessens - perhaps getting used to or perhaps lessening with airation. Feels like smelling tart underripe peach from a meter away, with mild rounded smoke wafting and combining in the middle. 

The booze does not feel like booze, more like smelling raw green/yellow paprika. Smoked candied pineapples. Seared white peaches, with a sprinkling of white sugar. Some drawing paper, held to a lighter and slightly browned. More dust. Lovely. Slightly torched (but not charred just yet) green paprika. 

# Taste
Golden sugar syrup, smoked honey, charred honey glazed wood, rounded sweet black pepper overload. Slightly charred vanilla. Honey more charred apple ash, bitterness of that apple ash. 

Honey soaked apples, bitterness of slight bit of candle wax? Like someone also lit a wax candle beside me. Burnt apple honey just before swallowing. Touch of candied pineapple - but smoked - somewhere in the middle, before disappearing. 

This ample burning candle wax like bitterness is the real hero here, balancing out the sweetness and paving the way for the rounded smoke that follows. Hints of really dusty haystacks. 

# Finish
More charred vanilla, rounded and subtle. Some faint residual saltiness. More honeyed and exquisitely smoked yellow fruit sweetness and the smokiness from the taste. C

ompletely burnt ashy apples like smokiness. Kind of somewhat remeniscent some of the older Ardbegs but the smoke here lasts longer more calm, more of immersive. 

# Overall
Extremely nice really. Its like a really well rounded well balanced version of the current 12. The smoke is mellow, allowing the honey like smoke to shine, but the smoke lasts long, intertwining with the tongue. 

The sour note on the nose could have felt ungroomed and characteristic of the shorter age, but you can see that it is really mellow, instead of coupling with the wood spice or other excess bitterness and going bonkers. 

Then the taste is a completely different experience altogether, because the calm yet intense smoke you get from some of the better Lagavulins. This really beats almost every older/premium Ardbegs for me, except for a few. Crazy such taste is accomplished in a 12 year old. 

Really nice - like a really nicely aired (current) Laphroaig 18, older bourbon Ardbeg rolled into one and made more sophisticated without losing the intensity, rather the sincerity. Really nice. Much better than the notes. Given blind, would have guessed at least 20, and more. 

# Score
89/100
