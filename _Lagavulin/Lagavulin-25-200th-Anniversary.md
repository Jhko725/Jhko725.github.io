# Nose
Surprisingly not funky sherry in the beginning, feels like stale white fruit - fermented white peaches, some European pear sweetness in the far back. 

Some sour tang here too, which is a bit surprising - the tang is like that of tart but slightlt oxidized apricots/peaches. Probably needs some airing, this one. 

Some kind of diluted balamic/sherry vinegar like tang/brown complexity. With time, some leather shoe and shoe polish, some stale caramel infused with stale red grapes. 

Slight but of burnt sugar - or Korean dalgona, but rounded and soft. With time, the sourness and the fresher notes are calmed, matured - oily, like browned butter perhaps. Oily caramel. Hints of terriyaki. Brown sugar, slightly burnt, and there is the faintest bit of umami somewhere, like the smallest speck of soybean paste thrown in somewhere. More funky sherry vinigar. 

The nose gets better with time. Caramel and smoked sugar sprinkled charred red grapes. More sweet leather furniture. Dusty red ripe grapes. Stale grape jelly. Brown butter and exqusite  caramel, some chocolate. Some grape jelly too -  by this time, the acidity dissipates. 

# Taste
Sweet, caramel but really nice, slightly diluted, leather shoe, smoked/burnt leather coated with rich caramel, some smoke from burnt black pepper and a sprinkle of smoked salt. 

Ripe red grape/grape syrup but salted with smoked salt and slightly blowtorched. Some charred apple sweetness too as you swallow. 

Leather furniture slathered with red grape jam, and some smoke and rounded bitterness of antique leather couch. Some more leather shoe polish with ripe grape syrup and more char of burnt grape skins. 

The grape is the star in this one, mature, subtly smoky and leather with old furniture. Tasty and well crafted. Fresh grape syrup, with smoked salt.

# Finish
More smoked salt, smoked antique leather furniture, trace of stale caramel made out of smoked sugar and infused with ever so slight bit of stale semi-dried grapes. Some charred apple sweetness. 

Could have offered more, as this lacks the funky sherry founed in the white horse 16, or the 1985 21 yr old. Feels like this needs quite a bit of airing, because the sourness does not necessarily improve the balance. 

Smoked sugar and this smokiness is what persists for a long time. Some red grape compote too. This juxtaposition of subtle Lagavulin smoke and the assertive rounded convincing red greape note is quite interesting. 

# Overall
Nice, and there are this rounded sophisticated smoke of Lagavulin present here. But the whisky seems to need more airing, as the sourness present doesn't necessarily contribute to the overall synergy. The fact that the funky sherry of the Lagavulin 21 is not present here is also another factor that makes me score this dram lower than the 21 1985. 

This mature grape notes paired with the antique old wooden brown furniture and leather couch, but the grape notes persisting is very interesting and distinctive. Tasty and give it time and when the less mature acidity and those dissipate, the whisky is quite nice, quite enjoyable. 

But there is a reason why Lagavulin 16 white horse and 21 1985 is cherished and this one fails to provide that extra old sherry umami that made those bottles legendary. Still, sherry, brown umami, and the salty calm Lagavumin smoke is amazing, Really really tasty, just not mythical.
