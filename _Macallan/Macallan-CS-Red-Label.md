# Nose
Intense raisins and old sherry (finally!). Intense terriyaki, but as if the sweetness of terriyaki was created by overripe grapes. More intense grape jam and blueberry jam. This is the kind of old sherry that I dream of. Almost a exhaust fume like smoky character, but for some crazy reason, this is not an off-putting flavor at all, rather a flavor a one might die for. Some caramel slathered on really fermented peaches. Some exquisite toffee. Some aroma of antique oak furniture. Some fermented blueberries. After even more time, some woody vanilla, but very faint, tinged with the faintest bit of nuttiness. In a way, similar to old Macallan 30 as well. Some stale uncooked pie pastry. There is some wood bark like herbal bitterness as well, and due to the herbal nature of the bitterness, this note acts as an additional complexifying agent. With more time, more nutty brown butter and toasted cashew, the booze is not offensive at all. Some musty grape skins. 

# Taste
Sweet caramel, intense grapes, intense overripe blueberries, intense caramel and slightly fermented peaches, slight apple soapiness, funky old sherry pervasive throughout, some oak tannins, but mild and very pleasent, just improving the mouthfeel, feeling like that of a nice expensive old black tea. Fully ripe red apples, some more caramel apples. Dark chocolate too. At the middle of the progression of flavors, there is a time where dark chocolate and slightly toasted/charred barley explode, then recede immediately after. Oak chip infused high quality caramel, more apple caramel but more exquisite.

# Finish
Some more ripe red apple sweetness, some chocolate tinged toffee and nutty caramel. The brown butter nuttiness continues for a long time after swallowing. Besides the nuttiness, the overripe grape syrup and the exhaust fume like character also linger extremely long inside the mouth. Just crazy good. When you swallow the saliva long after having finished the dram, you can still taste the blueberry and the musty grape skins. 

# Overall
Crazy good whisky, just leagues above any other Macallans that I have tried today (all the other Macallans in this entry + Grand Reserva 12 Gen 4 & Boutique 2016). The flavors inside the mouth evolve faster than I can type, and this is a very high compliment. This is much better than my words suggest, the flavors are complex, old and strong at the same time, which is an ultimate combination. The balance is perfect, the complexity is perfect, so many exquisite flavorsto enjoy. Personally, I feel that this is on the same level as Macallan 30. Perfect. Must try.
